This file consists of all things that need to be completed and all known bugs that need to be fixed

To do list:
	(searchserver.c) 
		1. Incorporate invertedIndex.gdb and dbtools in server
		2. Remove hashutils (in this phase we cannot use hsearch.h
	(crawler.c)
		1. add pdftohtml parsing functionality
		2. add .xml and .txt parsing functionality
		3. there are cases where base url is not present, so extractor ignores it, fix extractor
	(dbtools.c)
		1. make sure to check if '|', '<', and '>' exist in value.dptr
		3. Write documentation to explain how to use it 

All known bugs in project that need to be fixed:
	crawler.c:
		1. Handle cases where there is only a host name, no path name. 

	(searchserver.c)
		1. Does not work with chrome (at least for me).


Tom needs to document the following code and/or explain what each thing does.
	dbtools.c
	GDBM stuff (invertedIndex.gdb)
	queueADT.c

Notes:

Checking memory usage by writing bash script that calls program
./crawler <host> <path>
watch 'grep VmSize /proc/PID/status >> log'

The ISO C99 standard specifies that these macros must only be defined if explicitly requested.

#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
#include <inttypes.h>

... now PRIu64 will work

Debug print
#ifdef DEBUG
# define DEBUG_PRINT(x) printf x
#else
# define DEBUG_PRINT(x) do {} while (0)
#endif
